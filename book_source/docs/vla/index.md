# Vision Language Models for Robotics

Vision Language Models (VLAs) combine visual and linguistic understanding to enable robots to understand and execute natural language instructions.

## What are Vision Language Models?

VLAs are deep learning models trained on vast datasets of images and text, enabling them to:

- Understand visual scenes
- Process natural language instructions
- Generate robot action sequences
- Explain robot behavior

## Why VLAs Matter for Robotics

Traditional robot programming requires explicit coding. VLAs enable:

- **Natural interaction**: Instruct robots in natural language
- **Generalization**: Transfer learned skills to new tasks
- **Adaptability**: Handle open-ended, unseen scenarios

## Applications

- Manipulation in household environments
- Navigation in complex spaces
- Object detection and interaction
- Safety-aware behavior
