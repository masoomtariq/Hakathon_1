# Gazebo & Unity Simulation

Learn to use Gazebo and Unity for simulating robot behavior in virtual environments.

## What is Gazebo?

Gazebo is a 3D robotics simulator that integrates seamlessly with ROS 2.

## What is Unity?

Unity is a game engine increasingly used for high-fidelity robot simulation.

## When to Use Each

- **Gazebo**: Science-oriented, lightweight, native ROS 2 integration
- **Unity**: High-fidelity graphics, complex environments, visual feedback

## Learning Path

1. Start with Gazebo basics
2. Progress to world building
3. Explore physics engines
4. (Optional) Transition to Unity
