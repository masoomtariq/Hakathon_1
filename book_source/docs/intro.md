2. **Gazebo & Unity Simulation** — Master physics simulation and 3D visualization tools
3. **NVIDIA Isaac Robotics** — Explore digital twins and simulation-based learning
4. **Vision Language Models (VLA)** — Understand multimodal AI for robotics perception
5. **Capstone Project** — Apply everything in a comprehensive robotics project

## How to Use This Book

- **Read sequentially** for a comprehensive foundation
- **Jump to specific chapters** if you have prior knowledge
- **Use the search function** (Ctrl+K) to find topics quickly
- **Ask the AI assistant** (bottom-right) questions about any section

## Getting Started
