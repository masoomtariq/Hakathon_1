## Unique & Critical Project Setup/Feature Requirements

1. **Local Search Plugin Implementation**
   - The project shall provide fast, privacy-preserving, client-side search by configuring and using the self-hosted `@easyops-cn/docusaurus-search-local` plugin (book_source/docusaurus.config.ts).
   - *(Unique because local-only search, especially privacy-focused and self-hosted, is non-default in Docusaurus and addresses privacy/latency for sensitive content.)*

2. **Dark Mode as the Default with Theme Customization**
   - The project shall use dark mode as default and define a custom theming system (variables, overrides) in `book_source/src/css/custom.css` beyond Docusaurus’s basic theming.
   - *(Unique: Making dark mode default, not just supported, and providing custom theme variables is a user-centric add-on beyond defaults.)*

3. **Elaborate Homepage ("Marketing Site"-like Main Page)**
   - The project shall implement a homepage organized into five distinct informational/marketing sections: Hero, Book Summary, Learning Outcomes, Quotes, and Module Cards (see `book_source/src/pages/index.tsx`).
   - *(Unique: Custom homepage with educational and motivational sections built into Docusaurus rather than auto-generated/toc homepage.)*


4. **Self-Hosting & Automating Installation of Multiple Font Families (Incl. Urdu)**
   - The project shall self-host Inter, JetBrains Mono, and Noto Nastaliq Urdu fonts in `book_source/static/fonts`, automate their installation/setup via `book_source/scripts/setup-fonts.sh`, and apply proper CSS wiring in `book_source/src/css/custom.css`.
   - *(Unique: Bundling and automating the setup of both Latin and Urdu scripts for consistent rendering is notable and not default.)*

5. **Automated Full-Project Setup Script**
   - The project shall include an executable setup script (`book_source/scripts/setup.sh`) that, in a single step, installs dependencies, configures fonts, and checks type safety.
   - *(Unique: Going beyond `npm install` to automate font fetching/setup and typecheck ensures onboarding consistency.)*
