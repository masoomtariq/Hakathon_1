# Core Concepts

Understand the fundamental building blocks of ROS 2.

## Nodes

Nodes are processes that perform computation. Each node should be responsible for a single, modular purpose.

## Topics

Topics are named buses over which nodes exchange messages of a certain type.

## Services

Services are synchronous request-response primitives for communication between nodes.

## Packages

A package is the basic unit of ROS 2 organization. It contains libraries, executables, and configuration files.
