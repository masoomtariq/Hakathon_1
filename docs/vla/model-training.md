# Training Vision Language Models

Learn how to train and fine-tune VLAs for robotics tasks.

## Popular VLA Architectures

- **CLIP**: Vision-language understanding
- **BLIP-2**: Efficient vision-language alignment
- **GPT-4V**: Multimodal reasoning
- **RT-2**: Robotics Transformer 2

## Training Pipeline

1. Data collection (images + captions/actions)
2. Preprocessing and augmentation
3. Model selection and configuration
4. Training loop with loss functions
5. Evaluation and validation
6. Fine-tuning for robotics tasks

## Best Practices

- Use diverse, representative datasets
- Implement robust data augmentation
- Monitor loss curves and gradients
- Validate on held-out test sets
