# Deploying VLA Models

Deploy trained Vision Language Models on robotic systems.

## Deployment Targets

- **Edge devices**: Onboard compute (Jetson, mobile GPUs)
- **Cloud services**: AWS SageMaker, Azure ML, Google Vertex AI
- **Hybrid**: Edge inference with cloud training

## Optimization Techniques

- **Quantization**: Reduce model size and latency
- **Pruning**: Remove unnecessary parameters
- **Distillation**: Transfer knowledge to smaller models
- **Caching**: Pre-compute common operations

## ROS 2 Integration

Deploy VLA models as ROS 2 nodes for seamless integration.
