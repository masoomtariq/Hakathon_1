# Capstone Project: Intelligent Robotic System

This capstone project brings together everything you've learned to build an intelligent, autonomous robotic system.

## Project Overview

Design, simulate, and implement a robot that:

1. **Perceives** its environment using vision and sensors
2. **Understands** natural language instructions via VLMs
3. **Plans** and executes complex manipulation or navigation tasks
4. **Adapts** to novel situations and unexpected obstacles

## Learning Outcomes

By completing this capstone, you will:

- Integrate multiple ROS 2 nodes for sensor fusion and control
- Design and validate simulation environments in Gazebo/Isaac
- Implement perception pipelines with deep learning
- Deploy end-to-end systems on physical hardware
- Document and present your results professionally

## Project Structure

- [Project Scope & Requirements](/docs/capstone/project-scope)
- [Implementation Guide](/docs/capstone/implementation)
- [Evaluation & Validation](/docs/capstone/evaluation)

## Timeline

Plan for 200-300 hours of work spread over 8-12 weeks.
