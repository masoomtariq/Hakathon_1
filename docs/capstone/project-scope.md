# Project Scope & Requirements

Define your capstone project scope and requirements.

## Project Ideas

### 1. Mobile Manipulation Robot

Build a robot that combines navigation and object manipulation:

- Navigate autonomously to target locations
- Perceive and grasp target objects using VLMs
- Handle unexpected objects and obstacles

### 2. Collaborative Assembly System

Implement a robot that assists humans in assembly tasks:

- Understand verbal instructions from human collaborators
- Plan and execute cooperative manipulation
- Monitor safety constraints

### 3. Warehouse Automation System

Design a robot for inventory management:

- Navigate complex warehouse environments
- Identify and retrieve items based on descriptions
- Adapt to dynamic obstacles and map changes

## Evaluation Criteria

Projects will be evaluated on:

- **Functionality**: Does the system achieve its goals?
- **Robustness**: Does it handle edge cases gracefully?
- **Code Quality**: Is the codebase well-organized and documented?
- **Integration**: Are multiple systems properly integrated?
- **Novelty**: Does the project demonstrate creative problem-solving?
