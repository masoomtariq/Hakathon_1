# NVIDIA Isaac Robotics

NVIDIA Isaac is a platform for developing, testing, and deploying intelligent robots using digital twin technology.

## Key Concepts

### Digital Twins

A digital twin is a virtual replica of a physical robot or system, enabling simulation and testing before real-world deployment.

### Isaac Sim

Isaac Sim is a simulator built on NVIDIA Omniverse, providing photorealistic environments and physics simulation.

### Isaac ROS

Isaac ROS provides hardware-accelerated perception algorithms optimized for robotics on NVIDIA GPUs.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand digital twin architecture
- Create digital twins in Isaac Sim
- Deploy perception pipelines with Isaac ROS
- Integrate digital twins with real robots
