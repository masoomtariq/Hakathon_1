# Creating Digital Twins

Learn how to create and manage digital twins in NVIDIA Isaac.

## What is a Digital Twin?

A digital twin is a synchronized virtual model of a physical system that enables:

- **Simulation**: Test behaviors before deployment
- **Training**: Generate synthetic data for ML models
- **Monitoring**: Track real-time performance of physical assets

## Isaac Sim Basics

Isaac Sim runs on NVIDIA Omniverse, providing:

- Photorealistic rendering
- High-fidelity physics
- Real-time synchronization with physical hardware

## Creating Your First Digital Twin

Follow these steps to create a digital twin of a simple robot.
