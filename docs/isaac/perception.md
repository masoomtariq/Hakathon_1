# Perception with Isaac ROS

Implement hardware-accelerated perception pipelines using Isaac ROS.

## Hardware Acceleration

Isaac ROS leverages NVIDIA GPUs to accelerate perception algorithms.

## Supported Models

- Object detection (YOLO, Faster R-CNN)
- Semantic segmentation
- Instance segmentation
- Pose estimation

## Performance Benefits

Using GPU acceleration can improve perception throughput by 10-50x compared to CPU-based approaches.
